            <h2>Why I perfer dogs over cats</h2>
                <p>I think dogs are better than cats because they can do so much more stuff that cats cant.
                   Cats can also be harmful animals because they have very long claws. In my opinion dogs are so much better 
                   than cats becasue they are much funner. </p>
